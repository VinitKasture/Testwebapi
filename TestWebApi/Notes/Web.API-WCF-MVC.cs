         Lets understands all the protocols first
         
        HTTP
        Most common protocol, used by Restful servies, desktop apps, mobile apps and browsers
        Works across the internet, firewall-friendly, easy to debug (Postman FTW!)
        Not as fast or secure for internal systems as some other protocols.

        Named Pipes
        This one's more of a Windows-specific internal comms method. Super fast, but only works within the same machine or local network.
        Used for: Communication between apps on the same server
        Pros: Ultra-fast for local data sharing, easy to use in Windows
        Cons: Only works on Windows, not usable across the internet
